abstract = "Docker is the most popular implementation of Operating System virtualization, currently its online registry service (Docker Hub) stores more than 4.5 millions of software images. Using that registry it is possible to download and deploy Docker images as software containers. However, these images only show information of the main software, hiding the dependencies needed to run it.To allow users to track what they deploy into their machines, we developed DockerPedia, a resource that publishes information of the packages within the Docker images as Linked Data. Currently our resource includes 160.000 of the most downloaded images from Docker Hub providing information about the software dependencies and its vulnerabilities allowing to easily reproduce the environment in which each image was deployed as well as to check the security of the image without the need to download it."
